subtitle: Researching language learning and use across the lifespan
---

I am a researcher investigating how we acquire linguistic knowledge and how language experience supports learning across domains and throughout the lifespan. I am particularly interested in the transition from language as a goal in early development to language as a tool for thinking and learning in later years, and how this shift shapes language use and knowledge acquisition. In addressing these questions, I focus particularly on how prior knowledge shapes new learning, how learning mechanisms evolve across the lifespan, and how they adapt to different settings and instructional conditions. A central aim of my work is to design instruction that supports learning rather than creates unintended barriers. 

I am currently a Vice-Chancellor's Research Prize Fellow (tenure-track) in the Institute of Health and Neurodevelopment at Aston University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. 

I have a strong interest in **applied statistics** and care deeply about **open science** and healthy research culture. I am also passionate about **making research accessible** and **involving diverse voices into research** to drive positive change. If you're an educator, parent, or policymaker interested in collaborating, I'd love to hear from you!
