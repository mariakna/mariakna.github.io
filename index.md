subtitle: Researching language learning and use across the lifespan
---

I am a researcher interested in how we acquire linguistic knowledge and how our experience with language supports knowledge acquisition in other domains and across the lifespan. I focus in particular on how people learn and forget words — whether in first or later-acquired languages, through recreational reading, or in instructional settings — and on how our knowledge of word meanings changes over time. I use tools from cognitive science and neuroscience to address these questions.

I am currently a Vice-Chancellor's Research Prize Fellow (tenure-track) in the Institute of Health and Neurodevelopment at Aston University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. 

I have a strong interest in **applied statistics** and care deeply about **open science** and healthy research culture. I am also passionate about **making research accessible** and **involving diverse voices into research** to drive positive change. If you're an educator, parent, or policymaker interested in collaborating, I'd love to hear from you!
  
Outside of work, I'm either outdoors kayaking and hiking, or cosied up inside playing guitar, reading, knitting, sewing, or making pottery.
