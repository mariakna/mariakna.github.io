I'm excited to be giving a webinar for [Tooled Up Education](https://www.tooledupeducation.com/) on the power of reading for children's outcomes!
I'll be speaking to parents about why reading is so impactful and, importantly, how we can help children get the most out of their reading experience.

Please [reach out](https://www.tooledupeducation.com/contact) to colleagues at Tooled Up Education to join — I'd love to see you there!
