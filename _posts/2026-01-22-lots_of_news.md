It feels like a good moment to share a few updates from the past few weeks.

First, I started a **new role** at Aston University on 12 January. 
I'm now a **Vice-Chancellor's Research Prize Fellow (tenure-track)** in the [Institute of Health and Neurodevelopment](https://www.aston.ac.uk/research/hls/ihn).
I'll be building an independent research programme focused on different aspects of word learning through reading - more on that in due course :)

There have also been a couple of **recent paper acceptances**. 
One introduces a **new battery measuring print experience in UK primary school children** (in press in *Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology*; preprint and materials [here](https://osf.io/gmv72)).
The other, just published in *Journal of Memory and Language*, uses a compositional distributional semantic model to examine **what readers can learn about individual morphemes through reading** ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2026.104746)).
These mark the final two papers from my postdoc in the Rastle Lab at RHUL, which makes it feel like that chapter has now (nicely) come to a close...

I'll be presenting the modelling work from the JML paper at [TeaP](https://coms.app/teap26/welcome.html) in Tübingen in March, and again
at [SSSR](https://www.triplesr.org/sssr-thirty-third-annual-conference) in Rotterdam in July. The TeaP talk will be part of a symposium on computational modelling in psycholinguistics, and the SSSR talk will be part of a symposium (which I'm co-organising) on learning and teaching morphemes. 
As part of that symposium, a co-author will also present some very new collaborative work on bound stems, which I'm very excited about.

Finally, a really lovely piece of news: I was named *Researcher of the Month* by [Tooled Up Education](https://www.tooledupeducation.com/), an organisation that provides evidence-based resources for parents and educators. 
I gave a webinar for them in November on the power of reading, and the accompanying article (that they wrote based on that webinar) is freely available [here](https://www.tooledupeducation.com/research/the-power-of-reading-books-vocabulary-and-learning). 
It's been a genuine pleasure working with the Tooled Up Education team, and I'm very grateful for the experience!

That's probably enough updates for now - more soon!
