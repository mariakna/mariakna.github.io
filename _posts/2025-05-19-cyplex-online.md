The *Children and Young People's Books Lexicon (CYP-LEX)* I developed is now available as an interactive website: [https://cyp-lex.rastlelab.com/](https://cyp-lex.rastlelab.com/).
This online platform allows you to explore the database by querying specific words or extracting words with particular characteristics. 
Simply enter the words you'd like to look up -- or upload an Excel file -- and download the results in Excel format. 
I hope you find this new tool useful and that it supports your research!

PS: The files that constitue the database are of course still [available on OSF](https://osf.io/squ49/).
