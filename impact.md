### Collaborations with industry

In a [recent collaboration with The World Bank](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-02028-x), we show that students in low- and middle-income countries are failing to acquire the most basic skills necessary for reading comprehension. Our findings highlight that evidence-based phonics instruction is needed to support global literacy goals.
